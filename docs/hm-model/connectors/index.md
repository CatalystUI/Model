### *Where translation happens, and understanding is preserved.*

Connectors are the unseen bridges of CatalystUI—the gentle handoffs that carry meaning from one layer to the next without losing purpose or intent. Every time data changes form, a connector is there to guide it, making sure nothing is lost in translation as ideas move from abstraction to experience.

This section shows you the “in-between” moments of the model—the places where still concepts become motion, where structure becomes interaction, and where human action becomes digital understanding. Connectors exist because layers alone aren’t enough; there must be something that helps them speak the same language.

Explore each connector and see how they weave the stack together into a single, unified flow. You’ll discover that these transitions—quiet, precise, deliberate—are part of what gives Catalyst its strength: a model built not just on layers, but on the relationships that bind them.
