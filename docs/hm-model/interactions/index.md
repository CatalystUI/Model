### *Where intent becomes action, and action becomes data.*

Interactions are the starting point of every meaningful exchange between a human and a computer. They represent something simple but powerful: your intent. Not noise, not random input — but a deliberate expression of what you want the system to understand and respond to.

In CatalystUI, interactions are treated as a special form of data because they reflect the most important part of the entire cycle: the human presence at the bottom of the stack. This is where the model listens. This is where the computer learns what you’re trying to accomplish, one choice at a time.

This section walks you through how those intentions move upward — how Catalyst captures them, identifies them, and carries them faithfully into forms the computer can use. By understanding interactions, you’ll see how your intent shapes every layer above it, guiding how digital data is changed, stored, and eventually returned to you as experience.

Begin here, and you’ll understand the reason the entire stack exists: to honor human intent and give it a clear path into the digital world.
