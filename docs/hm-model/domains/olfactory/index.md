## Summary

The **olfactory** domain represents data expressed through smell—aromatic compounds, scent patterns, intensities, and timed releases. It is one of the most primal forms of human perception, deeply tied to memory, emotion, and instinct. And yet, within computing, it is also one of the least explored. While visuals, sound, and touch have become universal forms of digital output, scent remains rare, specialized, and highly experimental.

Still, the domain exists, and CatalystUI acknowledges it because humans experience the world through more than eyes, ears, and skin. Even if the technology is not yet mainstream, the model recognizes the potential: computers generating or modulating scents as a form of communication, immersion, or data expression.

Olfactory data begins the same way all perceptual data begins—symbolically. It starts as encoded instructions, chemical identifiers, or intensity values. Only through hardware capable of releasing or synthesizing aromatic compounds does this data become perceivable as scent. The olfactory domain describes the moment those symbolic structures are transformed into sensory experience.

This is a domain not of current ubiquity, but of emerging possibility—a frontier where human perception and computation may one day meet far more naturally.

## Core Characteristics

Olfactory data is defined by its expression through scent—by the translation of symbolic chemical or aromatic descriptors into perceivable smells delivered through specialized hardware.

- **Smell-based perception:** Olfactory data expresses itself through aromatic compounds sensed by the nose.
- **Highly experimental:** Very few mainstream devices support olfactory output; hardware varies widely in capability and maturity.
- **Rendered, not stored:** Scent instructions (chemical IDs, intensity curves, mixing ratios) produce smell only when interpreted by a scent-emitting device.
- **Chemically bound:** Unlike visuals or audio, olfactory output depends on stored or synthesized physical compounds.
- **Slow-response domain:** Scent dispersal, decay, blending, and clearing are slower and less controlled than other sensory channels.

## Appearances in The Stack

The olfactory domain’s behavior is especially dependent on hardware timing, chemical composition, and environmental airflow—far more than any other sensory domain.

- **Layer 5 — Components, Controls, & Layout:** Olfactory components may define scent cues (e.g., “emit lavender upon event,” “release alert scent,” “blend aromas over time”).

- **Layer 4 — Graphs & Frame:** Olfactory graphs manage sequences, durations, transition smoothing, and safe dispersal scheduling.

- **Layer 3 — Renderer:** Symbolic scent instructions become real aromas. Renderers may interface with experimental APIs, micro-diffusers, or chemical cartridges.

- **Layer 2 — Window:** Represents the olfactory channel or device session—often a scent emitter, cartridge-based system, or multi-channel diffuser.

## Examples of Olfactory Data

Olfactory data appears most often in experimental, artistic, or research contexts—but it follows the same rules of perception as any other domain.

### 1. Scent Release Instructions (compound IDs, intensity levels)

Symbolic chemical descriptors become olfactory when emitted into the air. These represent the core data structure of the domain.

### 2. Blended Aromas (mixtures, ratio curves)

Instructions describing the ratio between multiple aromatic compounds transform into perceivable scent blends.

### 3. Timed Scent Events (durations, pulses, intervals)

Time-based release schedules—used for storytelling, alerts, or sensory cues—become part of the olfactory output when executed.

### 4. Environmental Scent Effects (ambient scenting, VR scent augmentation)

Experimental systems in VR or entertainment environments release scents tied to scenes, weather, or emotional tone.

### 5. Research-Driven Chemosensory Output (medical, therapeutic, or experimental interfaces)

Scent-based cues may be used in cognitive studies, memory recall experiments, or therapeutic environments.

### 6. Cartridge or Diffuser Channel Activation (hardware channel selection)

Some devices contain multiple chemical reservoirs; olfactory data determines which cartridge to activate and how strongly.

## A Note on Technological Maturity

The olfactory domain is one of the most experimental areas of computing. While visuals, audio, and even tactile feedback have matured into universal interfaces, scent-based output remains niche, inconsistent, and limited by hardware availability. Nevertheless, its potential is unmistakable. If technology continues to bridge the gap between digital information and human sensory experience, olfaction may become a meaningful part of future interfaces—and CatalystUI includes it now so the model remains complete, truthful, and forward-facing.
