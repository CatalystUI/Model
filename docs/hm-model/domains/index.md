### *Where data finds its voice, and experience discovers its form.*

Domains describe the “senses” of CatalystUI—the different ways information can be felt, noticed, or understood once it leaves the world of zeros and ones. Each domain captures a unique channel of perception, from sight and sound to touch and beyond. Together, they reveal that computers don’t just process data—they express it.

This section invites you to see data the way Catalyst always intended: as something alive with potential, capable of reaching the human mind through many paths. By understanding domains, you’ll understand how your data chooses to speak, and why different types of experiences require different forms.

Walk through each domain, explore how they connect, and discover the beauty of a model that treats human perception not as a limitation, but as the guiding light for all communication between us and our machines.
