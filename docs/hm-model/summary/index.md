## Understanding Data Flow

The CatalystUI Model explains how computers turn data into something we can see, hear, or feel—and how our actions turn right back into data the computer understands. It reveals the simple, two-way conversation happening every time we interact with technology, mapping out the hidden contract between humans and machines.

## The Structure of Catalyst

The CatalystUI Model isn’t just a diagram—it’s a map of how every interaction between humans and computers really works. To make it easy to understand, the model is divided into three parts:

- [**Domains**](../domains/index.md) — the senses through which data is experienced.
- [**The Stack**](../the-stack/index.md) — the path data takes as it moves between humans and machines.
- [**Connectors**](../connectors/index.md) — the bridges that keep everything working together.

Together, these three form the heartbeat of Catalyst—a complete picture of how information becomes experience, and experience becomes information again.
