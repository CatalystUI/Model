## Introduction

Welcome to Catalyst—a new way of understanding how humans and computers interact. The CatalystUI Model lays out the simple, universal steps that happen every time we touch or use technology—whether it’s a computer, a screen, a remote, or any device built to store and share information. By making these steps visible, Catalyst turns what once felt hidden into something you can see, explore, and build on.

## A Brief Backstory

Catalyst was born out of years of frustration with the limits of modern frameworks. Every tool promised cross-platform power, performance, or simplicity—but always at the cost of another. Time after time, the answer from the community was the same: “That’s just the way it is.”

But what if it isn’t?

Instead of accepting compromise, CatalystUI began with a different question: what if the problem isn’t the tools at all, but the way we think about human-computer interaction? What if, like the OSI model for networks, there’s a deeper truth behind how data moves between people and machines?

The answer became the CatalystUI Model—a universal map that shows the exact steps every interaction takes, from raw data to human experience, and back again. It’s not a new framework layered on top of old problems—it’s a foundation built on truth.

## Where to Begin

Big ideas can feel overwhelming at first, but Catalyst is designed to be simple and approachable. The first step is learning the core words we use. These definitions aren’t here to weigh you down—they’re here to give you clarity, so everything else feels natural and consistent.
